Problem 3 : 
take a list say  adhoc=[1,2,3,1,4,5,66,22,2,6,0,9]
write the program that will do
  i)  print only those numbers greater than 5
  ii)  also print those numbers those are less than or  equals to 2  ( <= 2 )
  iii)  store these answers in in two different list also
solution- 
adhoc=[1,2,3,1,4,5,66,22,2,6,0,9]
x=[]
y=[]
for i in adhoc :
   if(i>5):
     print(i)
     x.append(i)
for i in adhoc:
   if(i<=2):
     print(i) 
     y.append(i)
print(x)
print(y)
